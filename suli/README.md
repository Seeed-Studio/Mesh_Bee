About Suli
------------
Suli means Seeed Unified Library Interface.

### Why Suli?
We have hundreds of sensors, actuators, displays and other useful modules. In the past, we mainly focused on Arduino applications, and supplied Arduino Library only. This means if you used another platform such as Raspberry, LauchPad, or MCS51, you needed to port our Library, and sometimes it’s not easy.

Sometimes when some customers asked us to provide some libraries for a non-Arduino platform, what we could do was telling them “hey man, we only have Arduino library.” Replying the customers in this way made us feel bad.

And we have been thinking what if there’s a way to make our libraries fit all platforms. It’s really a hard task, but not impossible. And we are lucky to figure it out finally: it’s Suli – Seeed Unified Library Interface, which can make almost all of(at least 90%) our libraries fit many common platforms, or at least make it easy to port.
